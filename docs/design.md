# Design Document

## Overview
The Distributed Training Framework is designed to support both data and model parallelism for training large models efficiently. It implements pipeline parallelism, Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO), custom communication patterns, and automatic sharding strategies.

## Architecture
- **Pipeline Parallelism**: Splits model layers across devices for efficient training.
- **ZeRO**: Reduces memory usage by partitioning optimizer states.
- **Communication Patterns**: Optimizes communication between devices.
- **Sharding Strategies**: Automatically shards model parameters for distributed training.
